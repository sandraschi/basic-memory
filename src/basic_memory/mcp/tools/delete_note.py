            # Delete Failed - Note Not Found

            The note '{identifier}' could not be found for deletion.

            ## This might mean:
            1. **Already deleted**: The note may have been deleted previously
            2. **Wrong identifier**: The identifier format might be incorrect
            3. **Different project**: The note might be in a different project

            ## How to verify:
            1. **Search for the note**: Use `search_notes("{search_term}")` to find it
            2. **Try different formats**:
               - If you used a permalink like "folder/note-title", try just the title: "{title_format}"
               - If you used a title, try the permalink format: "{permalink_format}"

            3. **Check if already deleted**: Use `list_directory("/")` to see what notes exist
            4. **Check current project**: Use `get_current_project()` to verify you're in the right project

            ## If the note actually exists:
            ```
            # First, find the correct identifier:
            search_notes("{identifier}")

            # Then delete using the correct identifier:
            delete_note("correct-identifier-from-search")
            ```

            ## If you want to delete multiple similar notes:
            Use search to find all related notes and delete them one by one.

## Alternative actions:
- Check current project: `get_current_project()`
- Switch to correct project: `switch_project("project-name")`
- Verify note exists first: `read_note("{identifier}")`

Send a message to support@basicmachines.co to request deletion, or ask someone with write access to delete the note."""

3. **Check disk space**: Ensure the system has adequate storage

## Troubleshooting:
- Verify note exists: `read_note("{identifier}")`
- Check project status: `get_current_project()`
- Try again in a few moments

1. **Sync conflict**: The file system and database are out of sync
2. **Database lock**: Another operation is accessing the database
3. **Corrupted entry**: The database entry might be corrupted

## Steps to resolve:
1. **Try again**: Wait a moment and retry the deletion
2. **Check note status**: `read_note("{identifier}")` to see current state
3. **Manual verification**: Use `list_directory()` to see if file still exists

Error deleting note '{identifier}': {error_message}

## General troubleshooting:
1. **Verify the note exists**: `read_note("{identifier}")` or `search_notes("{identifier}")`
2. **Check permissions**: Ensure you can edit/delete files in this project
3. **Try again**: The error might be temporary
4. **Check project**: Make sure you're in the correct project

## Step-by-step approach:
```
# 1. Confirm note exists and get correct identifier
search_notes("{identifier}")

# 2. Read the note to verify access
read_note("correct-identifier-from-search")

# 3. Try deletion with correct identifier
delete_note("correct-identifier-from-search")
```

## Alternative approaches:
- Check what notes exist: `list_directory("/")`
- Verify current project: `get_current_project()`
- Switch projects if needed: `switch_project("correct-project")`

## Need help?
If the note should be deleted but the operation keeps failing, send a message to support@basicmachines.co."""


@mcp.tool(
    description="""Remove notes from the Basic Memory knowledge base with relationship cleanup and safety checks.

This tool permanently deletes notes while handling semantic relationship cleanup and providing
comprehensive error reporting to guide successful operations.

DELETION PROCESS:
1. Locate note by exact identifier (title or permalink)
2. Verify note exists and is accessible
3. Remove note file from filesystem
4. Clean up semantic relationships and references
5. Update knowledge graph connections
6. Remove from search indexes

SAFETY FEATURES:
- Exact identifier matching (no fuzzy deletion)
- Existence verification before deletion
- Detailed error reporting with recovery suggestions
- Project boundary validation
- Relationship impact assessment

PARAMETERS:
- identifier (str, REQUIRED): Exact note title or permalink for deletion
- project (str, optional): Specific project to delete from (defaults to active project)

IDENTIFIER FORMATS:
- Title: "Meeting Notes: Project Planning"
- Permalink: "notes/project-planning"
- Memory URL: "memory://notes/project-planning"

RELATIONSHIP HANDLING:
- Bidirectional link cleanup ([[Note References]])
- Knowledge graph relationship removal
- Entity connection updates
- Reference integrity maintenance

USAGE EXAMPLES:
By title: delete_note("Meeting Notes: Project Planning")
By permalink: delete_note("notes/project-planning")
Specific project: delete_note("important-note", project="work-project")

RETURNS:
Boolean True if deletion successful, or detailed error message with recovery guidance.

ERROR RECOVERY:
- Not found: Suggestions for correct identifier format
- Permission issues: Access and project validation guidance
- Relationship conflicts: Impact assessment and alternatives

NOTE: Deletion is permanent. Consider using search_notes() first to verify exact identifiers.
Deleted content cannot be recovered - ensure correct note is targeted.""",
