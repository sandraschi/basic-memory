# Basic Memory

Basic Memory lets you build persistent knowledge through natural conversations with Large Language Models (LLMs) like
Claude, while keeping everything in simple Markdown files on your computer. It uses the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to
enable any compatible LLM to read and write to your local knowledge base.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install with uv (recommended)
uv tool install basic-memory

# or with Homebrew
brew tap basicmachines-co/basic-memory
brew install basic-memory

# Configure Claude Desktop (edit ~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json)
# Add this to your config:
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "basic-memory": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "basic-memory",
        "mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
# Now in Claude Desktop, you can:
# - Write notes with "Create a note about coffee brewing methods"
# - Read notes with "What do I know about pour over coffee?"
# - Search with "Find information about Ethiopian beans"

```

You can view shared context via files in `~/basic-memory` (default directory location).

### Alternative Installation via Smithery

You can use [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/@basicmachines-co/basic-memory) to automatically configure Basic
Memory for Claude Desktop:

```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli install @basicmachines-co/basic-memory --client claude
```

This installs and configures Basic Memory without requiring manual edits to the Claude Desktop configuration file. Note: The Smithery installation uses their hosted MCP server, while your data remains stored locally as Markdown files.

### Add to Cursor

Once you have installed Basic Memory revisit this page for the 1-click installer for Cursor:

## Why Basic Memory?

Most LLM interactions are ephemeral - you ask a question, get an answer, and everything is forgotten. Each conversation
starts fresh, without the context or knowledge from previous ones. Current workarounds have limitations:

- Chat histories capture conversations but aren't structured knowledge
- RAG systems can query documents but don't let LLMs write back
- Vector databases require complex setups and often live in the cloud
- Knowledge graphs typically need specialized tools to maintain

Basic Memory addresses these problems with a simple approach: structured Markdown files that both humans and LLMs can
read
and write to. The key advantages:

- **Local-first:** All knowledge stays in files you control
- **Bi-directional:** Both you and the LLM read and write to the same files
- **Structured yet simple:** Uses familiar Markdown with semantic patterns
- **Traversable knowledge graph:** LLMs can follow links between topics
- **Standard formats:** Works with existing editors like Obsidian
- **Lightweight infrastructure:** Just local files indexed in a local SQLite database

With Basic Memory, you can:

- Have conversations that build on previous knowledge
- Create structured notes during natural conversations
- Have conversations with LLMs that remember what you've discussed before
- Navigate your knowledge graph semantically
- Keep everything local and under your control
- Use familiar tools like Obsidian to view and edit notes
- Build a personal knowledge base that grows over time

## How It Works in Practice

Let's say you're exploring coffee brewing methods and want to capture your knowledge. Here's how it works:

1. Start by chatting normally:

```
I've been experimenting with different coffee brewing methods. Key things I've learned:

- Pour over gives more clarity in flavor than French press
- Water temperature is critical - around 205°F seems best
- Freshly ground beans make a huge difference
```

... continue conversation.

2. Ask the LLM to help structure this knowledge:

```
"Let's write a note about coffee brewing methods."
```

LLM creates a new Markdown file on your system (which you can see instantly in Obsidian or your editor):

```markdown
---
title: Coffee Brewing Methods
permalink: coffee-brewing-methods
tags:
- coffee
- brewing
---

# Coffee Brewing Methods

## Observations

- [method] Pour over provides more clarity and highlights subtle flavors
- [technique] Water temperature at 205°F (96°C) extracts optimal compounds
- [principle] Freshly ground beans preserve aromatics and flavor

## Relations

- relates_to [[Coffee Bean Origins]]
- requires [[Proper Grinding Technique]]
- affects [[Flavor Extraction]]
```

The note embeds semantic content and links to other topics via simple Markdown formatting.

3. You see this file on your computer in real time in the current project directory (default `~/$HOME/basic-memory`).

- Realtime sync is enabled by default starting with v0.12.0
- Project switching during conversations is supported starting with v0.13.0

4. In a chat with the LLM, you can reference a topic:

```
Look at `coffee-brewing-methods` for context about pour over coffee
```

The LLM can now build rich context from the knowledge graph. For example:

```
Following relation 'relates_to [[Coffee Bean Origins]]':
- Found information about Ethiopian Yirgacheffe
- Notes on Colombian beans' nutty profile
- Altitude effects on bean characteristics

Following relation 'requires [[Proper Grinding Technique]]':
- Burr vs. blade grinder comparisons
- Grind size recommendations for different methods
- Impact of consistent particle size on extraction
```

Each related document can lead to more context, building a rich semantic understanding of your knowledge base.

This creates a two-way flow where:

- Humans write and edit Markdown files
- LLMs read and write through the MCP protocol
- Sync keeps everything consistent
- All knowledge stays in local files.

## Technical Implementation

Under the hood, Basic Memory:

1. Stores everything in Markdown files
2. Uses a SQLite database for searching and indexing
3. Extracts semantic meaning from simple Markdown patterns
    - Files become `Entity` objects
    - Each `Entity` can have `Observations`, or facts associated with it
    - `Relations` connect entities together to form the knowledge graph
4. Maintains the local knowledge graph derived from the files
5. Provides bidirectional synchronization between files and the knowledge graph
6. Implements the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for AI integration
7. Exposes tools that let AI assistants traverse and manipulate the knowledge graph
8. Uses memory:// URLs to reference entities across tools and conversations

The file format is just Markdown with some simple markup:

Each Markdown file has:

### Frontmatter

```markdown
title: <Entity title>
type: <The type of Entity> (e.g. note)
permalink: <a uri slug>

- <optional metadata> (such as tags)
```

### Observations

Observations are facts about a topic.
They can be added by creating a Markdown list with a special format that can reference a `category`, `tags` using a
"#" character, and an optional `context`.

Observation Markdown format:

```markdown
- [category] content #tag (optional context)
```

Examples of observations:

```markdown
- [method] Pour over extracts more floral notes than French press
- [tip] Grind size should be medium-fine for pour over #brewing
- [preference] Ethiopian beans have bright, fruity flavors (especially from Yirgacheffe)
- [fact] Lighter roasts generally contain more caffeine than dark roasts
- [experiment] Tried 1:15 coffee-to-water ratio with good results
- [resource] James Hoffman's V60 technique on YouTube is excellent
- [question] Does water temperature affect extraction of different compounds differently?
- [note] My favorite local shop uses a 30-second bloom time
```

### Relations

Relations are links to other topics. They define how entities connect in the knowledge graph.

Markdown format:

```markdown
- relation_type [[WikiLink]] (optional context)
```

Examples of relations:

```markdown
- pairs_well_with [[Chocolate Desserts]]
- grown_in [[Ethiopia]]
- contrasts_with [[Tea Brewing Methods]]
- requires [[Burr Grinder]]
- improves_with [[Fresh Beans]]
- relates_to [[Morning Routine]]
- inspired_by [[Japanese Coffee Culture]]
- documented_in [[Coffee Journal]]
```

[![Install with UV in VS Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code-UV-0098FF?style=flat-square&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=white)](https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=basic-memory&config=%7B%22command%22%3A%22uvx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22basic-memory%22%2C%22mcp%22%5D%7D) [![Install with UV in VS Code Insiders](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code_Insiders-UV-24bfa5?style=flat-square&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=white)](https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=basic-memory&config=%7B%22command%22%3A%22uvx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22basic-memory%22%2C%22mcp%22%5D%7D&quality=insiders)

You can use Basic Memory with VS Code to easily retrieve and store information while coding. Click the installation buttons above for one-click setup, or follow the manual installation instructions below.

### Manual Installation

Add the following JSON block to your User Settings (JSON) file in VS Code. You can do this by pressing `Ctrl + Shift + P` and typing `Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)`.

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "basic-memory": {
        "command": "uvx",
        "args": ["basic-memory", "mcp"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Optionally, you can add it to a file called `.vscode/mcp.json` in your workspace. This will allow you to share the configuration with others.

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "basic-memory": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["basic-memory", "mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Using with Claude Desktop

Basic Memory is built using the MCP (Model Context Protocol) and works with the Claude desktop app (https://claude.ai/):

1. Configure Claude Desktop to use Basic Memory:

Edit your MCP configuration file (usually located at `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
for OS X):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "basic-memory": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "basic-memory",
        "mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

If you want to use a specific project (see [Multiple Projects](docs/User%20Guide.md#multiple-projects)), update your
Claude Desktop
config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "basic-memory": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "basic-memory",
        "--project",
        "your-project-name",
        "mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

2. Sync your knowledge:

Basic Memory will sync the files in your project in real time if you make manual edits.

3. In Claude Desktop, the LLM can now use these tools:

```
write_note(title, content, folder, tags) - Create or update notes
read_note(identifier, page, page_size) - Read notes by title or permalink
edit_note(identifier, operation, content) - Edit notes incrementally (append, prepend, find/replace)
move_note(identifier, destination_path) - Move notes with database consistency
view_note(identifier) - Display notes as formatted artifacts for better readability
build_context(url, depth, timeframe) - Navigate knowledge graph via memory:// URLs
search_notes(query, page, page_size) - Search across your knowledge base
recent_activity(type, depth, timeframe) - Find recently updated information
canvas(nodes, edges, title, folder) - Generate knowledge visualizations
list_memory_projects() - List all available projects with status
switch_project(project_name) - Switch to different project context
get_current_project() - Show current project and statistics
create_memory_project(name, path, set_default) - Create new projects
delete_project(name) - Delete projects from configuration
set_default_project(name) - Set default project
sync_status() - Check file synchronization status
```

5. Example prompts to try:

```
"Create a note about our project architecture decisions"
"Find information about JWT authentication in my notes"
"Create a canvas visualization of my project components"
"Read my notes on the authentication system"
"What have I been working on in the past week?"
"Switch to my work-notes project"
"List all my available projects"
"Edit my coffee brewing note to add a new technique"
"Move my old meeting notes to the archive folder"
```
